I really enjoy riding my [Jamis Allegro A3](https://99spokes.com/bikes/jamis/2021/allegro-a3) hybrid/fitness bike and exploring the areas east of Raleigh, NC. I'll try to update this post with photos from recent rides.

After a few months of riding my Mongoose Crossway, I have decided to upgrade to a nicer hybrid bike.

My son has started to enjoy riding as well. He can easily ride 2-3 miles, and I have to sprint to keep up.

My first time exploring White Oak Creek Greenway. The Piedmont region of North Carolina (near Raleigh) has an excellent and ever-growing network of trails that are closed to vehicles. These trails are called **greenways** and are a great way to bike safely.
